HeisenUI is a Minecraft library that was created during ModJam 4. The purpose is to create a GUI builder much like that of Apple's [Interface Builder](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interface_Builder). HeisenUI completely streamlines Minecraft GUI design by introducing a graphical editor, and a MVC design pattern.
